              "'\\nIndia, officially the Republic of India (Hindi: Bhārat Gaṇarājya),[23] is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country, and the most populous democracy in the world. Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west;[f] China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand, Myanmar and Indonesia.\\nModern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago.[24]\\nTheir long occupation, initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers, has made the region highly diverse, second only to Africa in human genetic diversity.[25] Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago, evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE.[26]\\nBy 1200\\xa0BCE, an archaic form of Sanskrit, an Indo-European language, had diffused into India from the northwest,[27] unfolding as the language of the Rigveda, and recording the dawning of Hinduism in India.[28] The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern and western regions.[29]\\nBy 400\\xa0BCE, stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism,[30]\\nand Buddhism and Jainism had arisen, proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity.[31]\\nEarly political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin.[32]\\nTheir collective era was suffused with wide-ranging creativity,[33] but also marked by the declining status of women,[34] and the incorporation of untouchability into an organised system of belief.[g][35] In South India, the Middle kingdoms exported Dravidian-languages scripts and religious cultures to the kingdoms of Southeast Asia.[36]\\nIn the early medieval era, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Zoroastrianism put down roots on India\\'s southern and western coasts.[37]\\nMuslim armies from Central Asia intermittently overran India\\'s northern plains,[38]\\neventually establishing the Delhi Sultanate, and drawing northern India into the cosmopolitan networks of medieval Islam.[39]\\nIn the 15th century, the Vijayanagara Empire created a long-lasting composite Hindu culture in south India.[40]\\nIn the Punjab, Sikhism emerged, rejecting institutionalised religion.[41]\\nThe Mughal Empire, in 1526, ushered in two centuries of relative peace,[42]\\nleaving a legacy of luminous architecture.[h][43]\\nGradually expanding rule of the British East India Company followed, turning India into a colonial economy, but also consolidating its sovereignty.[44] British Crown rule began in 1858. The rights promised to Indians were granted slowly,[45] but technological changes were introduced, and ideas of education, modernity and the public life took root.[46]\\nA pioneering and influential nationalist movement emerged, which was noted for nonviolent resistance and became the major factor in ending British rule.[47] In 1947 the British Indian Empire was partitioned into two independent dominions, a Hindu-majority Dominion of India and a Muslim-majority Dominion of Pakistan, amid large-scale loss of life and an unprecedented migration.[48][49]\\nIndia has been a federal republic since 1950, governed in a democratic parliamentary system. It is a pluralistic, multilingual and multi-ethnic society. India\\'s population grew from 361 million in 1951 to 1.211\\xa0billion in 2011.[50]\\nDuring the same time, its nominal per capita income increased from US$64 annually to US$1,498, and its literacy rate from 16.6% to 74%. From being a comparatively destitute country in 1951,[51]\\nIndia has become a fast-growing major economy and a hub for information technology services, with an expanding middle class.[52] It has a space programme which includes several planned or completed extraterrestrial missions. Indian movies, music, and spiritual teachings play an increasing role in global culture.[53]\\nIndia has substantially reduced its rate of poverty, though at the cost of increasing economic inequality.[54]\\nIndia is a nuclear-weapon state, which ranks high in military expenditure. It has disputes over Kashmir with its neighbours, Pakistan and China, unresolved since the mid-20th century.[55]\\nAmong the socio-economic challenges India faces are gender inequality, child malnutrition,[56]\\nand rising levels of air pollution.[57]\\nIndia\\'s land is megadiverse, with four biodiversity hotspots.[58] Its forest cover comprises 21.7% of its area.[59] India\\'s wildlife, which has traditionally been viewed with tolerance in India\\'s culture,[60] is supported among these forests, and elsewhere, in protected habitats.\\nAccording to the Oxford English Dictionary (third edition 2009), the name \"India\" is derived from the Classical Latin India, a reference to South Asia and an uncertain region to its east; and in turn derived successively from: Hellenistic Greek India ( Ἰνδία); ancient Greek Indos ( Ἰνδός); Old Persian Hindush, an eastern province of the Achaemenid empire; and ultimately its cognate, the Sanskrit Sindhu, or \"river,\" specifically the Indus River and, by implication, its well-settled southern basin.[61][62] The ancient Greeks referred to the Indians as Indoi (Ἰνδοί), which translates as \"The people of the Indus\".[63]\\nThe term Bharat (Bhārat; pronounced\\xa0[ˈbʱaːɾət] (listen)), mentioned in both Indian epic poetry and the Constitution of India,[64][65] is used in its variations by many Indian languages. A modern rendering of the historical name Bharatavarsha, which applied originally to northern India,[66][67] Bharat gained increased currency from the mid-19th century as a native name for India.[64][68]\\nHindustan ([ɦɪndʊˈstaːn] (listen)) is a Middle Persian name for India, introduced during the Mughal Empire and used widely since. Its meaning has varied, referring to a region encompassing present-day northern India and Pakistan or to India in its near entirety.[64][68][69]\\nBy 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans, or Homo sapiens, had arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa, where they had earlier evolved.[72][73][74] The earliest known modern human remains in South Asia date to about 30,000 years ago.[75] After 6500\\xa0BCE, evidence for domestication of food crops and animals, construction of permanent structures, and storage of agricultural surplus appeared in Mehrgarh and other sites in what is now Balochistan, Pakistan.[76] These gradually developed into the Indus Valley Civilisation,[77][76] the first urban culture in South Asia,[78] which flourished during 2500–1900\\xa0BCE in what is now Pakistan and western India.[79] Centred around cities such as Mohenjo-daro, Harappa, Dholavira, and Kalibangan, and relying on varied forms of subsistence, the civilisation engaged robustly in crafts production and wide-ranging trade.[78]\\nDuring the period 2000–500\\xa0BCE, many regions of the subcontinent transitioned from the Chalcolithic cultures to the Iron Age ones.[80] The Vedas, the oldest scriptures associated with Hinduism,[81] were composed during this period,[82] and historians have analysed these to posit a Vedic culture in the Punjab region and the upper Gangetic Plain.[80] Most historians also consider this period to have encompassed several waves of Indo-Aryan migration into the subcontinent from the north-west.[81] The caste system, which created a hierarchy of priests, warriors, and free peasants, but which excluded indigenous peoples by labelling their occupations impure, arose during this period.[83] On the Deccan Plateau, archaeological evidence from this period suggests the existence of a chiefdom stage of political organisation.[80] In South India, a progression to sedentary life is indicated by the large number of megalithic monuments dating from this period,[84] as well as by nearby traces of agriculture, irrigation tanks, and craft traditions.[84]\\nIn the late Vedic period, around the 6th century BCE, the small states and chiefdoms of the Ganges Plain and the north-western regions had consolidated into 16 major oligarchies and monarchies that were known as the mahajanapadas.[85][86] The emerging urbanisation gave rise to non-Vedic religious movements, two of which became independent religions. Jainism came into prominence during the life of its exemplar, Mahavira.[87] Buddhism, based on the teachings of Gautama Buddha, attracted followers from all social classes excepting the middle class; chronicling the life of the Buddha was central to the beginnings of recorded history in India.[88][89][90] In an age of increasing urban wealth, both religions held up renunciation as an ideal,[91] and both established long-lasting monastic traditions. Politically, by the 3rd century BCE, the kingdom of Magadha had annexed or reduced other states to emerge as the Mauryan Empire.[92] The empire was once thought to have controlled most of the subcontinent except the far south, but its core regions are now thought to have been separated by large autonomous areas.[93][94] The Mauryan kings are known as much for their empire-building and determined management of public life as for Ashoka\\'s renunciation of militarism and far-flung advocacy of the Buddhist dhamma.[95][96]\\nThe Sangam literature of the Tamil language reveals that, between 200\\xa0BCE and 200\\xa0CE, the southern peninsula was ruled by the Cheras, the Cholas, and the Pandyas, dynasties that traded extensively with the Roman Empire and with West and South-East Asia.[97][98] In North India, Hinduism asserted patriarchal control within the family, leading to increased subordination of women.[99][92] By the 4th and 5th centuries, the Gupta Empire had created a complex system of administration and taxation in the greater Ganges Plain; this system became a model for later Indian kingdoms.[100][101] Under the Guptas, a renewed Hinduism based on devotion, rather than the management of ritual, began to assert itself.[102] This renewal was reflected in a flowering of sculpture and architecture, which found patrons among an urban elite.[101] Classical Sanskrit literature flowered as well, and Indian science, astronomy, medicine, and mathematics made significant advances.[101]\\nThe Indian early medieval age, from 600 to 1200\\xa0CE, is defined by regional kingdoms and cultural diversity.[103] When Harsha of Kannauj, who ruled much of the Indo-Gangetic Plain from 606 to 647\\xa0CE, attempted to expand southwards, he was defeated by the Chalukya ruler of the Deccan.[104] When his successor attempted to expand eastwards, he was defeated by the Pala king of Bengal.[104] When the Chalukyas attempted to expand southwards, they were defeated by the Pallavas from farther south, who in turn were opposed by the Pandyas and the Cholas from still farther south.[104] No ruler of this period was able to create an empire and consistently control lands much beyond their core region.[103] During this time, pastoral peoples, whose land had been cleared to make way for the growing agricultural economy, were accommodated within caste society, as were new non-traditional ruling classes.[105] The caste system consequently began to show regional differences.[105]\\nIn the 6th and 7th centuries, the first devotional hymns were created in the Tamil language.[106] They were imitated all over India and led to both the resurgence of Hinduism and the development of all modern languages of the subcontinent.[106] Indian royalty, big and small, and the temples they patronised drew citizens in great numbers to the capital cities, which became economic hubs as well.[107] Temple towns of various sizes began to appear everywhere as India underwent another urbanisation.[107] By the 8th and 9th centuries, the effects were felt in South-East Asia, as South Indian culture and political systems were exported to lands that became part of modern-day Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia, and Java.[108] Indian merchants, scholars, and sometimes armies were involved in this transmission; South-East Asians took the initiative as well, with many sojourning in Indian seminaries and translating Buddhist and Hindu texts into their languages.[108]\\nAfter the 10th century, Muslim Central Asian nomadic clans, using swift-horse cavalry and raising vast armies united by ethnicity and religion, repeatedly overran South Asia\\'s north-western plains, leading eventually to the establishment of the Islamic Delhi Sultanate in 1206.[109] The sultanate was to control much of North India and to make many forays into South India. Although at first disruptive for the Indian elites, the sultanate largely left its vast non-Muslim subject population to its own laws and customs.[110][111] By repeatedly repulsing Mongol raiders in the 13th century, the sultanate saved India from the devastation visited on West and Central Asia, setting the scene for centuries of migration of fleeing soldiers, learned men, mystics, traders, artists, and artisans from that region into the subcontinent, thereby creating a syncretic Indo-Islamic culture in the north.[112][113] The sultanate\\'s raiding and weakening of the regional kingdoms of South India paved the way for the indigenous Vijayanagara Empire.[114] Embracing a strong Shaivite tradition and building upon the military technology of the sultanate, the empire came to control much of peninsular India,[115] and was to influence South Indian society for long afterwards.[114]\\nIn the early 16th century, northern India, then under mainly Muslim rulers,[116] fell again to the superior mobility and firepower of a new generation of Central Asian warriors.[117] The resulting Mughal Empire did not stamp out the local societies it came to rule. Instead, it balanced and pacified them through new administrative practices[118][119] and diverse and inclusive ruling elites,[120] leading to more systematic, centralised, and uniform rule.[121] Eschewing tribal bonds and Islamic identity, especially under Akbar, the Mughals united their far-flung realms through loyalty, expressed through a Persianised culture, to an emperor who had near-divine status.[120] The Mughal state\\'s economic policies, deriving most revenues from agriculture[122] and mandating that taxes be paid in the well-regulated silver currency,[123] caused peasants and artisans to enter larger markets.[121] The relative peace maintained by the empire during much of the 17th century was a factor in India\\'s economic expansion,[121] resulting in greater patronage of painting, literary forms, textiles, and architecture.[124] Newly coherent social groups in northern and western India, such as the Marathas, the Rajputs, and the Sikhs, gained military and governing ambitions during Mughal rule, which, through collaboration or adversity, gave them both recognition and military experience.[125] Expanding commerce during Mughal rule gave rise to new Indian commercial and political elites along the coasts of southern and eastern India.[125] As the empire disintegrated, many among these elites were able to seek and control their own affairs.[126]\\nBy the early 18th century, with the lines between commercial and political dominance being increasingly blurred, a number of European trading companies, including the English East India Company, had established coastal outposts.[127][128] The East India Company\\'s control of the seas, greater resources, and more advanced military training and technology led it to increasingly assert its military strength and caused it to become attractive to a portion of the Indian elite; these factors were crucial in allowing the company to gain control over the Bengal region by 1765 and sideline the other European companies.[129][127][130][131] Its further access to the riches of Bengal and the subsequent increased strength and size of its army enabled it to annexe or subdue most of India by the 1820s.[132] India was then no longer exporting manufactured goods as it long had, but was instead supplying the British Empire with raw materials. Many historians consider this to be the onset of India\\'s colonial period.[127] By this time, with its economic power severely curtailed by the British parliament and having effectively been made an arm of British administration, the company began more consciously to enter non-economic arenas like education, social reform, and culture.[133]\\nHistorians consider India\\'s modern age to have begun sometime between 1848 and 1885. The appointment in 1848 of Lord Dalhousie as Governor General of the East India Company set the stage for changes essential to a modern state. These included the consolidation and demarcation of sovereignty, the surveillance of the population, and the education of citizens. Technological changes—among them, railways, canals, and the telegraph—were introduced not long after their introduction in Europe.[134][135][136][137] However, disaffection with the company also grew during this time and set off the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Fed by diverse resentments and perceptions, including invasive British-style social reforms, harsh land taxes, and summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes, the rebellion rocked many regions of northern and central India and shook the foundations of Company rule.[138][139] Although the rebellion was suppressed by 1858, it led to the dissolution of the East India Company and the direct administration of India by the British government. Proclaiming a unitary state and a gradual but limited British-style parliamentary system, the new rulers also protected princes and landed gentry as a feudal safeguard against future unrest.[140][141] In the decades following, public life gradually emerged all over India, leading eventually to the founding of the Indian National Congress in 1885.[142][143][144][145]\\nThe rush of technology and the commercialisation of agriculture in the second half of the 19th century was marked by economic setbacks and many small farmers became dependent on the whims of far-away markets.[146] There was an increase in the number of large-scale famines,[147] and, despite the risks of infrastructure development borne by Indian taxpayers, little industrial employment was generated for Indians.[148] There were also salutary effects: commercial cropping, especially in the newly canalled Punjab, led to increased food production for internal consumption.[149] The railway network provided critical famine relief,[150] notably reduced the cost of moving goods,[150] and helped nascent Indian-owned industry.[149]\\nAfter World War I, in which approximately one million Indians served,[151] a new period began. It was marked by British reforms but also repressive legislation, by more strident Indian calls for self-rule, and by the beginnings of a nonviolent movement of non-co-operation, of which Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi would become the leader and enduring symbol.[152] During the 1930s, slow legislative reform was enacted by the British; the Indian National Congress won victories in the resulting elections.[153] The next decade was beset with crises: Indian participation in World War\\xa0II, the Congress\\'s final push for non-co-operation, and an upsurge of Muslim nationalism. All were capped by the advent of independence in 1947, but tempered by the partition of India into two states: India and Pakistan.[154]\\nVital to India\\'s self-image as an independent nation was its constitution, completed in 1950, which put in place a secular and democratic republic.[155] It has remained a democracy with civil liberties, an active Supreme Court, and a largely independent press.[156] Economic liberalisation, which began in the 1990s, has created a large urban middle class, transformed India into one of the world\\'s fastest-growing economies,[157] and increased its geopolitical clout. Indian movies, music, and spiritual teachings play an increasing role in global culture.[156] Yet, India is also shaped by seemingly unyielding poverty, both rural and urban;[156] by religious and caste-related violence;[158] by Maoist-inspired Naxalite insurgencies;[159] and by separatism in Jammu and Kashmir and in Northeast India.[160] It has unresolved territorial disputes with China[161] and with Pakistan.[161] India\\'s sustained democratic freedoms are unique among the world\\'s newer nations; however, in spite of its recent economic successes, freedom from want for its disadvantaged population remains a goal yet to be achieved.[162]\\nIndia accounts for the bulk of the Indian subcontinent, lying atop the Indian tectonic plate, a part of the Indo-Australian Plate.[163] India\\'s defining geological processes began 75 million years ago when the Indian Plate, then part of the southern supercontinent Gondwana, began a north-eastward drift caused by seafloor spreading to its south-west, and later, south and south-east.[163] Simultaneously, the vast Tethyan oceanic crust, to its northeast, began to subduct under the Eurasian Plate.[163] These dual processes, driven by convection in the Earth\\'s mantle, both created the Indian Ocean and caused the Indian continental crust eventually to under-thrust Eurasia and to uplift the Himalayas.[163] Immediately south of the emerging Himalayas, plate movement created a vast trough that rapidly filled with river-borne sediment[164] and now constitutes the Indo-Gangetic Plain.[165] Cut off from the plain by the ancient Aravalli Range lies the Thar Desert.[166]\\nThe original Indian Plate survives as peninsular India, the oldest and geologically most stable part of India. It extends as far north as the Satpura and Vindhya ranges in central India. These parallel chains run from the Arabian Sea coast in Gujarat in the west to the coal-rich Chota Nagpur Plateau in Jharkhand in the east.[167] To the south, the remaining peninsular landmass, the Deccan Plateau, is flanked on the west and east by coastal ranges known as the Western and Eastern Ghats;[168] the plateau contains the country\\'s oldest rock formations, some over one billion years old. Constituted in such fashion, India lies to the north of the equator between 6° 44′ and 35° 30′ north latitude[i] and 68° 7′ and 97° 25′ east longitude.[169]\\nIndia\\'s coastline measures 7,517 kilometres (4,700\\xa0mi) in length; of this distance, 5,423 kilometres (3,400\\xa0mi) belong to peninsular India and 2,094 kilometres (1,300\\xa0mi) to the Andaman, Nicobar, and Lakshadweep island chains.[170] According to the Indian naval hydrographic charts, the mainland coastline consists of the following: 43% sandy beaches; 11% rocky shores, including cliffs; and 46% mudflats or marshy shores.[170]\\nMajor Himalayan-origin rivers that substantially flow through India include the Ganges and the Brahmaputra, both of which drain into the Bay of Bengal.[172] Important tributaries of the Ganges include the Yamuna and the Kosi; the latter\\'s extremely low gradient, caused by long-term silt deposition, leads to severe floods and course changes.[173][174] Major peninsular rivers, whose steeper gradients prevent their waters from flooding, include the Godavari, the Mahanadi, the Kaveri, and the Krishna, which also drain into the Bay of Bengal;[175] and the Narmada and the Tapti, which drain into the Arabian Sea.[176] Coastal features include the marshy Rann of Kutch of western India and the alluvial Sundarbans delta of eastern India; the latter is shared with Bangladesh.[177] India has two archipelagos: the Lakshadweep, coral atolls off India\\'s south-western coast; and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, a volcanic chain in the Andaman Sea.[178]\\nThe Indian climate is strongly influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert, both of which drive the economically and culturally pivotal summer and winter monsoons.[179] The Himalayas prevent cold Central Asian katabatic winds from blowing in, keeping the bulk of the Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations at similar latitudes.[180][181] The Thar Desert plays a crucial role in attracting the moisture-laden south-west summer monsoon winds that, between June and October, provide the majority of India\\'s rainfall.[179] Four major climatic groupings predominate in India: tropical wet, tropical dry, subtropical humid, and montane.[182]\\nTemperatures in India have risen by 0.7\\xa0°C (1.3\\xa0°F) between 1901 and 2018.[183] Climate change in India is often thought to be the cause. The retreat of Himalayan glaciers has adversely affected the flow rate of the major Himalayan rivers, including the Ganges and the Brahmaputra.[184] According to some current projections, the number and severity of droughts in India will have markedly increased by the end of the present century.[185]\\nIndia is a megadiverse country, a term employed for 17 countries which display high biological diversity and contain many species exclusively indigenous, or endemic, to them.[186] India is a habitat for 8.6% of all mammal species, 13.7% of bird species, 7.9% of reptile species, 6% of amphibian species, 12.2% of fish species, and 6.0% of all flowering plant species.[187][188] Fully a third of Indian plant species are endemic.[189] India also contains four of the world\\'s 34 biodiversity hotspots,[58] or regions that display significant habitat loss in the presence of high endemism.[j][190]\\nIndia\\'s forest cover is 99,278\\xa0km2 (38,331\\xa0sq\\xa0mi), which is 21.67% of the country\\'s total land area.[59] It can be subdivided further into broad categories of canopy density, or the proportion of the area of a forest covered by its tree canopy.[191] Very dense forest, whose canopy density is greater than 70%, occupies 3.02% of India\\'s land area.[191][59] It predominates in the tropical moist forest of the Andaman Islands, the Western Ghats, and Northeast India.[192] Moderately dense forest, whose canopy density is between 40% and 70%, occupies 9.39% of India\\'s land area.[191][59] It predominates in the temperate coniferous forest of the Himalayas, the moist deciduous sal forest of eastern India, and the dry deciduous teak forest of central and southern India.[192] Open forest, whose canopy density is between 10% and 40%, occupies 9.26% of India\\'s land area,[191][59] and predominates in the babul-dominated thorn forest of the central Deccan Plateau and the western Gangetic plain.[192]\\nAmong the Indian subcontinent\\'s notable indigenous trees are the astringent Azadirachta indica, or neem, which is widely used in rural Indian herbal medicine,[193] and the luxuriant Ficus religiosa, or peepul,[194] which is displayed on the ancient seals of Mohenjo-daro,[195] and under which the Buddha is recorded in the Pali canon to have sought enlightenment.[196]\\nMany Indian species have descended from those of Gondwana, the southern supercontinent from which India separated more than 100 million years ago.[198] India\\'s subsequent collision with Eurasia set off a mass exchange of species. However, volcanism and climatic changes later caused the extinction of many endemic Indian forms.[199] Still later, mammals entered India from Asia through two zoogeographical passes flanking the Himalayas.[192] This had the effect of lowering endemism among India\\'s mammals, which stands at 12.6%, contrasting with 45.8% among reptiles and 55.8% among amphibians.[188] Notable endemics are the vulnerable[200] hooded leaf monkey[201] and the threatened[202] Beddom\\'s toad[202][203] of the Western Ghats.\\nIndia contains 172 IUCN-designated threatened animal species, or 2.9% of endangered forms.[204] These include the endangered Bengal tiger and the Ganges river dolphin. Critically endangered species include: the gharial, a crocodilian; the great Indian bustard; and the Indian white-rumped vulture, which has become nearly extinct by having ingested the carrion of diclofenac-treated cattle.[205] The pervasive and ecologically devastating human encroachment of recent decades has critically endangered Indian wildlife. In response, the system of national parks and protected areas, first established in 1935, was expanded substantially. In 1972, India enacted the Wildlife Protection Act[206] and Project Tiger to safeguard crucial wilderness; the Forest Conservation Act was enacted in 1980 and amendments added in 1988.[207] India hosts more than five hundred wildlife sanctuaries and thirteen\\xa0biosphere reserves,[208] four of which are part of the World Network of Biosphere Reserves; twenty-five wetlands are registered under the Ramsar Convention.[209]\\nIndia is the world\\'s most populous democracy.[211] A parliamentary republic with a multi-party system,[212] it has eight\\xa0recognised national parties, including the Indian National Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and more than 40\\xa0regional parties.[213] The Congress is considered centre-left in Indian political culture,[214] and the BJP right-wing.[215][216][217] For most of the period between 1950—when India first became a republic—and the late 1980s, the Congress held a majority in the parliament. Since then, however, it has increasingly shared the political stage with the BJP,[218] as well as with powerful regional parties which have often forced the creation of multi-party coalition governments at the centre.[219]\\nIn the Republic of India\\'s first three general elections, in 1951, 1957, and 1962, the Jawaharlal Nehru-led Congress won easy victories. On Nehru\\'s death in 1964, Lal Bahadur Shastri briefly became prime minister; he was succeeded, after his own unexpected death in 1966, by Nehru\\'s daughter Indira Gandhi, who went on to lead the Congress to election victories in 1967 and 1971. Following public discontent with the state of emergency she declared in 1975, the Congress was voted out of power in 1977; the then-new Janata Party, which had opposed the emergency, was voted in. Its government lasted just over two years. Voted back into power in 1980, the Congress saw a change in leadership in 1984, when Indira Gandhi was assassinated; she was succeeded by her son Rajiv Gandhi, who won an easy victory in the general elections later that year. The Congress was voted out again in 1989 when a National Front coalition, led by the newly formed Janata Dal in alliance with the Left Front, won the elections; that government too proved relatively short-lived, lasting just under two years.[220] Elections were held again in 1991; no party won an absolute majority. The Congress, as the largest single party, was able to form a minority government led by P. V. Narasimha Rao.[221]\\nA two-year period of political turmoil followed the general election of 1996. Several short-lived alliances shared power at the centre. The BJP formed a government briefly in 1996; it was followed by two comparatively long-lasting United Front coalitions, which depended on external support. In 1998, the BJP was able to form a successful coalition, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). Led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the NDA became the first non-Congress, coalition government to complete a five-year term.[222] Again in the 2004 Indian general elections, no party won an absolute majority, but the Congress emerged as the largest single party, forming another successful coalition: the United Progressive Alliance (UPA). It had the support of left-leaning parties and MPs who opposed the BJP. The UPA returned to power in the 2009 general election with increased numbers, and it no longer required external support from India\\'s communist parties.[223] That year, Manmohan Singh became the first prime minister since Jawaharlal Nehru in 1957 and 1962 to be re-elected to a consecutive five-year term.[224] In the 2014 general election, the BJP became the first political party since 1984 to win a majority and govern without the support of other parties.[225] The incumbent prime minister is Narendra Modi, a former chief minister of Gujarat. On 20 July 2017, Ram Nath Kovind was elected India\\'s 14th president and took the oath of office on 25 July 2017.[226][227][228]\\nIndia is a federation with a parliamentary system governed under the Constitution of India—the country\\'s supreme legal document. It is a constitutional republic and representative democracy, in which \"majority rule is tempered by minority rights protected by law\". Federalism in India defines the power distribution between the union and the states. The Constitution of India, which came into effect on 26 January 1950,[230] originally stated India to be a \"sovereign, democratic republic;\" this characterisation was amended in 1971 to \"a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic\".[231] India\\'s form of government, traditionally described as \"quasi-federal\" with a strong centre and weak states,[232] has grown increasingly federal since the late 1990s as a result of political, economic, and social changes.[233][234]\\nThe Government of India comprises three branches:[235]\\nIndia is a federal union comprising 28 states and 8 union territories (listed below as 1–28 and A–H, respectively).[251] All states, as well as the union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, Puducherry and the National Capital Territory of Delhi, have elected legislatures and governments following the Westminster system of governance. The remaining five union territories are directly ruled by the central government through appointed administrators. In 1956, under the States Reorganisation Act, states were reorganised on a linguistic basis.[252] There are over a quarter of a million local government bodies at city, town, block, district and village levels.[253]\\nIn the 1950s, India strongly supported decolonisation in Africa and Asia and played a leading role in the Non-Aligned Movement.[255] After initially cordial relations with neighbouring China, India went to war with China in 1962, and was widely thought to have been humiliated.[256] India has had tense relations with neighbouring Pakistan; the two nations have gone to war four times: in 1947, 1965, 1971, and 1999. Three of these wars were fought over the disputed territory of Kashmir, while the fourth, the 1971 war, followed from India\\'s support for the independence of Bangladesh.[257] In the late 1980s, the Indian military twice intervened abroad at the invitation of the host country: a peace-keeping operation in Sri Lanka between 1987 and 1990; and an armed intervention to prevent a 1988 coup d\\'état attempt in the Maldives. After the 1965 war with Pakistan, India began to pursue close military and economic ties with the Soviet Union; by the late 1960s, the Soviet Union was its largest arms supplier.[258]\\nAside from ongoing its special relationship with Russia,[259] India has wide-ranging defence relations with Israel and France. In recent years, it has played key roles in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation and the World Trade Organization. The nation has provided 100,000 military and police personnel to serve in 35 UN peacekeeping operations across four continents. It participates in the East Asia Summit, the G8+5, and other multilateral forums.[260] India has close economic ties with countries in South America,[261] Asia, and Africa; it pursues a \"Look East\" policy that seeks to strengthen partnerships with the ASEAN nations, Japan, and South Korea that revolve around many issues, but especially those involving economic investment and regional security.[262][263]\\nChina\\'s nuclear test of 1964, as well as its repeated threats to intervene in support of Pakistan in the 1965 war, convinced India to develop nuclear weapons.[265] India conducted its first nuclear weapons test in 1974 and carried out additional underground testing in 1998. Despite criticism and military sanctions, India has signed neither the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty nor the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, considering both to be flawed and discriminatory.[266] India maintains a \"no first use\" nuclear policy and is developing a nuclear triad capability as a part of its \"Minimum Credible Deterrence\" doctrine.[267][268] It is developing a ballistic missile defence shield and, a fifth-generation fighter jet.[269][270] Other indigenous military projects involve the design and implementation of Vikrant-class aircraft carriers and Arihant-class nuclear submarines.[271]\\nSince the end of the Cold War, India has increased its economic, strategic, and military co-operation with the United States and the European Union.[272] In 2008, a civilian nuclear agreement was signed between India and the United States. Although India possessed nuclear weapons at the time and was not a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, it received waivers from the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Nuclear Suppliers Group, ending earlier restrictions on India\\'s nuclear technology and commerce. As a consequence, India became the sixth de facto nuclear weapons state.[273] India subsequently signed co-operation agreements involving civilian nuclear energy with Russia,[274] France,[275] the United Kingdom,[276] and Canada.[277]\\nThe President of India is the supreme commander of the nation\\'s armed forces; with 1.45\\xa0million active troops, they compose the world\\'s second-largest military. It comprises the Indian Army, the Indian Navy, the Indian Air Force, and the Indian Coast Guard.[278] The official Indian defence budget for 2011 was US$36.03\\xa0billion, or 1.83% of GDP.[279] For the fiscal year spanning 2012–2013, US$40.44\\xa0billion was budgeted.[280] According to a 2008 Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) report, India\\'s annual military expenditure in terms of purchasing power stood at US$72.7\\xa0billion.[281] In 2011, the annual defence budget increased by 11.6%,[282] although this does not include funds that reach the military through other branches of government.[283] As of 2012[update], India is the world\\'s largest arms importer; between 2007 and 2011, it accounted for 10% of funds spent on international arms purchases.[284] Much of the military expenditure was focused on defence against Pakistan and countering growing Chinese influence in the Indian Ocean.[282] In May 2017, the Indian Space Research Organisation launched the South Asia Satellite, a gift from India to its neighbouring SAARC countries.[285] In October 2018, India signed a US$5.43\\xa0billion (over ₹400\\xa0billion) agreement with Russia to procure four S-400 Triumf surface-to-air missile defence systems, Russia\\'s most advanced long-range missile defence system.[286]\\nAccording to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Indian economy in 2020 was nominally worth $2.7\\xa0trillion; it is the sixth-largest economy by market exchange rates, and is around $8.9\\xa0trillion, the third-largest by purchasing power parity (PPP).[290] With its average annual GDP growth rate of 5.8% over the past two decades, and reaching 6.1% during 2011–2012,[291] India is one of the world\\'s fastest-growing economies.[292] However, the country ranks 139th in the world in nominal GDP per capita and 118th in GDP per capita at PPP.[293] Until 1991, all Indian governments followed protectionist policies that were influenced by socialist economics. Widespread state intervention and regulation largely walled the economy off from the outside world. An acute balance of payments crisis in 1991 forced the nation to liberalise its economy;[294] since then it has moved slowly towards a free-market system[295][296] by emphasising both foreign trade and direct investment inflows.[297] India has been a member of WTO since 1 January 1995.[298]\\nThe 522-million-worker Indian labour force is the world\\'s second-largest, as of 2017[update].[278] The service sector makes up 55.6% of GDP, the industrial sector 26.3% and the agricultural sector 18.1%. India\\'s foreign exchange remittances of US$70\\xa0billion in 2014, the largest in the world, were contributed to its economy by 25 million Indians working in foreign countries.[299] Major agricultural products include: rice, wheat, oilseed, cotton, jute, tea, sugarcane, and potatoes.[251] Major industries include: textiles, telecommunications, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, food processing, steel, transport equipment, cement, mining, petroleum, machinery, and software.[251] In 2006, the share of external trade in India\\'s GDP stood at 24%, up from 6% in 1985.[295] In 2008, India\\'s share of world trade was 1.68%;[300] In 2011, India was the world\\'s tenth-largest importer and the nineteenth-largest exporter.[301] Major exports include: petroleum products, textile goods, jewellery, software, engineering goods, chemicals, and manufactured leather goods.[251] Major imports include: crude oil, machinery, gems, fertiliser, and chemicals.[251] Between 2001 and 2011, the contribution of petrochemical and engineering goods to total exports grew from 14% to 42%.[302] India was the world\\'s second largest textile exporter after China in the 2013 calendar year.[303]\\nAveraging an economic growth rate of 7.5% for several years prior to 2007,[295] India has more than doubled its hourly wage rates during the first decade of the 21st century.[304] Some 431 million Indians have left poverty since 1985; India\\'s middle classes are projected to number around 580\\xa0million by 2030.[305] Though ranking 51st in global competitiveness, as of 2010[update], India ranks 17th in financial market sophistication, 24th in the banking sector, 44th in business sophistication, and 39th in innovation, ahead of several advanced economies.[306] With seven of the world\\'s top 15 information technology outsourcing companies based in India, as of 2009[update], the country is viewed as the second-most favourable outsourcing destination after the United States.[307] India was ranked 48th in the Global Innovation Index in 2020, it has increased its ranking considerably since 2015, where it was 81st.[308][309][310][311] India\\'s consumer market, the world\\'s eleventh-largest, is expected to become fifth-largest by 2030.[305]\\nDriven by growth, India\\'s nominal GDP per capita increased steadily from US$329 in 1991, when economic liberalisation began, to US$1,265 in 2010, to an estimated US$1,723 in 2016. It is expected to grow to US$2,191 by 2021.[19] However, it has remained lower than those of other Asian developing countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Thailand, and is expected to remain so in the near future.\\nAccording to a 2011 PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) report, India\\'s GDP at purchasing power parity could overtake that of the United States by 2045.[313] During the next four decades, Indian GDP is expected to grow at an annualised average of 8%, making it potentially the world\\'s fastest-growing major economy until 2050.[313] The report highlights key growth factors: a young and rapidly growing working-age population; growth in the manufacturing sector because of rising education and engineering skill levels; and sustained growth of the consumer market driven by a rapidly growing middle-class.[313] The World Bank cautions that, for India to achieve its economic potential, it must continue to focus on public sector reform, transport infrastructure, agricultural and rural development, removal of labour regulations, education, energy security, and public health and nutrition.[314]\\nAccording to the Worldwide Cost of Living Report 2017 released by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) which was created by comparing more than 400 individual prices across 160 products and services, four of the cheapest cities were in India: Bangalore (3rd), Mumbai (5th), Chennai (5th) and New Delhi (8th).[315]\\nIndia\\'s telecommunication industry is the second-largest in the world with over 1.2 billion subscribers. It contributes 6.5% to India\\'s GDP.[316] After the third quarter of 2017, India surpassed the US to become the second largest smartphone market in the world after China.[317]\\nThe Indian automotive industry, the world\\'s second-fastest growing, increased domestic sales by 26% during 2009–2010,[318] and exports by 36% during 2008–2009.[319] At the end of 2011, the Indian IT industry employed 2.8\\xa0million professionals, generated revenues close to US$100\\xa0billion equalling 7.5% of Indian GDP, and contributed 26% of India\\'s merchandise exports.[320]\\nThe pharmaceutical industry in India emerged as a global player. As of 2021, with 3000 pharmaceutical companies and 10,500 manufacturing units India is the world\\'s third-largest pharmaceutical producer, largest producer of generic medicines and supply up to 50%—60% of global vaccines demand, these all contribute up to US$24.44\\xa0billions in exports and India\\'s local pharmacutical market is estimated up to US$42\\xa0billion.[321][322] India is among the top 12 biotech destinations in the world.[323][324] The Indian biotech industry grew by 15.1% in 2012–2013, increasing its revenues from ₹204.4\\xa0billion (Indian rupees) to ₹235.24\\xa0billion (US$3.94 billion at June 2013 exchange rates).[325]\\nIndia\\'s capacity to generate electrical power is 300 gigawatts, of which 42 gigawatts is renewable.[326] The country\\'s usage of coal is a major cause of greenhouse gas emissions by India but its renewable energy is competing strongly.[327] India emits about 7% of global greenhouse gas emissions. This equates to about 2.5 tons of carbon dioxide per person per year, which is half the world average.[328][329] Increasing access to electricity and clean cooking with liquefied petroleum gas have been priorities for energy in India.[330]\\nDespite economic growth during recent decades, India continues to face socio-economic challenges. In 2006, India contained the largest number of people living below the World Bank\\'s international poverty line of US$1.25 per day.[332] The proportion decreased from 60% in 1981 to 42% in 2005.[333] Under the World Bank\\'s later revised poverty line, it was 21% in 2011.[l][335] 30.7% of India\\'s children under the age of five are underweight.[336] According to a Food and Agriculture Organization report in 2015, 15% of the population is undernourished.[337][338] The Mid-Day Meal Scheme attempts to lower these rates.[339]\\nAccording to a 2016 Walk Free Foundation report there were an estimated 18.3\\xa0million people in India, or 1.4% of the population, living in the forms of modern slavery, such as bonded labour, child labour, human trafficking, and forced begging, among others.[340][341][342] According to the 2011 census, there were 10.1\\xa0million child labourers in the country, a decline of 2.6\\xa0million from 12.6\\xa0million in 2001.[343]\\nSince 1991, economic inequality between India\\'s states has consistently grown: the per-capita net state domestic product of the richest states in 2007 was 3.2 times that of the poorest.[344] Corruption in India is perceived to have decreased. According to the Corruption Perceptions Index, India ranked 78th out of 180 countries in 2018 with a score of 41 out of 100, an improvement from 85th in 2014.[345][346]\\nWith 1,210,193,422 residents reported in the 2011 provisional census report,[347] India is the world\\'s second-most populous country. Its population grew by 17.64% from 2001 to 2011,[348] compared to 21.54% growth in the previous decade (1991–2001).[348] The human sex ratio, according to the 2011 census, is 940 females per 1,000 males.[347] The median age was 28.7 as of 2020[update].[278] The first post-colonial census, conducted in 1951, counted 361\\xa0million people.[349] Medical advances made in the last 50 years as well as increased agricultural productivity brought about by the \"Green Revolution\" have caused India\\'s population to grow rapidly.[350]\\nThe average life expectancy in India is at 68 years—69.6 years for women, 67.3 years for men.[351] There are around 50 physicians per 100,000 Indians.[352] Migration from rural to urban areas has been an important dynamic in India\\'s recent history. The number of people living in urban areas grew by 31.2% between 1991 and 2001.[353] Yet, in 2001, over 70% still lived in rural areas.[354][355] The level of urbanisation increased further from 27.81% in the 2001 Census to 31.16% in the 2011 Census. The slowing down of the overall population growth rate was due to the sharp decline in the growth rate in rural areas since 1991.[356] According to the 2011 census, there are 53 million-plus urban agglomerations in India; among them Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad, in decreasing order by population.[357] The literacy rate in 2011 was 74.04%: 65.46% among females and 82.14% among males.[358] The rural-urban literacy gap, which was 21.2 percentage points in 2001, dropped to 16.1 percentage points in 2011. The improvement in the rural literacy rate is twice that of urban areas.[356] Kerala is the most literate state with 93.91% literacy; while Bihar the least with 63.82%.[358]\\nIndia is home to two major language families: Indo-Aryan (spoken by about 74% of the population) and Dravidian (spoken by 24% of the population). Other languages spoken in India come from the Austroasiatic and Sino-Tibetan language families. India has no national language.[359] Hindi, with the largest number of speakers, is the official language of the government.[360][361] English is used extensively in business and administration and has the status of a \"subsidiary official language\";[5] it is important in education, especially as a medium of higher education. Each state and union territory has one or more official languages, and the constitution recognises in particular 22 \"scheduled languages\".\\nThe 2011 census reported the religion in India with the largest number of followers was Hinduism (79.80% of the population), followed by Islam (14.23%); the remaining were Christianity (2.30%), Sikhism (1.72%), Buddhism (0.70%), Jainism (0.36%) and others[m] (0.9%).[14] India has the third-largest Muslim population—the largest for a non-Muslim majority country.[362][363]\\nIndian cultural history spans more than 4,500 years.[364] During the Vedic period (c.\\u20091700\\xa0BCE\\xa0– c.\\u2009500\\xa0BCE), the foundations of Hindu philosophy, mythology, theology and literature were laid, and many beliefs and practices which still exist today, such as dhárma, kárma, yóga, and mokṣa, were established.[63] India is notable for its religious diversity, with Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Islam, Christianity, and Jainism among the nation\\'s major religions.[365] The predominant religion, Hinduism, has been shaped by various historical schools of thought, including those of the Upanishads,[366] the Yoga Sutras, the Bhakti movement,[365] and by Buddhist philosophy.[367]\\nSouth Asia has an ancient tradition of art, which has exchanged influences with the parts of Eurasia. Seals from the third millennium BCE Indus Valley Civilization of Pakistan and northern India have been found, usually carved with animals, but a few with human figures. The \"Pashupati\" seal, excavated in Mohenjo-daro, Pakistan, in 1928–29, is the best known.[368][369] After this there is a long period with virtually nothing surviving.[369][370] Almost all surviving ancient Indian art thereafter is in various forms of religious sculpture in durable materials, or coins. There was probably originally far more in wood, which is lost. In north India Mauryan art is the first imperial movement.[371][372][373] In the first millennium CE, Buddhist art spread with Indian religions to Central, East and South-East Asia, the last also greatly influenced by Hindu art.[374] Over the following centuries a distinctly Indian style of sculpting the human figure developed, with less interest in articulating precise anatomy than ancient Greek sculpture but showing smoothly-flowing forms expressing prana (\"breath\" or life-force).[375][376] This is often complicated by the need to give figures multiple arms or heads, or represent different genders on the left and right of figures, as with the Ardhanarishvara form of Shiva and Parvati.[377][378]\\nMost of the earliest large sculpture is Buddhist, either excavated from Buddhist stupas such as Sanchi, Sarnath and Amaravati,[379] or is rock-cut reliefs at sites such as Ajanta, Karla and Ellora. Hindu and Jain sites appear rather later.[380][381] In spite of this complex mixture of religious traditions, generally, the prevailing artistic style at any time and place has been shared by the major religious groups, and sculptors probably usually served all communities.[382] Gupta art, at its peak c.\\u2009300\\xa0CE\\xa0– c.\\u2009500\\xa0CE, is often regarded as a classical period whose influence lingered for many centuries after; it saw a new dominance of Hindu sculpture, as at the Elephanta Caves.[383][384] Across the north, this became rather stiff and formulaic after c.\\u2009800\\xa0CE, though rich with finely carved detail in the surrounds of statues.[385] But in the South, under the Pallava and Chola dynasties, sculpture in both stone and bronze had a sustained period of great achievement; the large bronzes with Shiva as Nataraja have become an iconic symbol of India.[386][387]\\nAncient painting has only survived at a few sites, of which the crowded scenes of court life in the Ajanta Caves are by far the most important, but it was evidently highly developed, and is mentioned as a courtly accomplishment in Gupta times.[388][389] Painted manuscripts of religious texts survive from Eastern India about the 10th century onwards, most of the earliest being Buddhist and later Jain. No doubt the style of these was used in larger paintings.[390] The Persian-derived Deccan painting, starting just before the Mughal miniature, between them give the first large body of secular painting, with an emphasis on portraits, and the recording of princely pleasures and wars.[391][392] The style spread to Hindu courts, especially among the Rajputs, and developed a variety of styles, with the smaller courts often the most innovative, with figures such as Nihâl Chand and Nainsukh.[393][394] As a market developed among European residents, it was supplied by Company painting by Indian artists with considerable Western influence.[395][396] In the 19th century, cheap Kalighat paintings of gods and everyday life, done on paper, were urban folk art from Calcutta, which later saw the Bengal School of Art, reflecting the art colleges founded by the British, the first movement in modern Indian painting.[397][398]\\nBhutesvara Yakshis, Buddhist reliefs from Mathura, 2nd century\\xa0CE\\nGupta terracotta relief, Krishna Killing the Horse Demon Keshi, 5th century\\nElephanta Caves, triple-bust (trimurti) of Shiva, 18 feet (5.5\\xa0m) tall, c.\\u2009550\\nJahangir Receives Prince Khurram at Ajmer on His Return from the Mewar Campaign, Balchand,  c.\\u20091635\\nKrishna Fluting to the Milkmaids, Kangra painting, 1775–1785\\nMuch of Indian architecture, including the Taj Mahal, other works of Mughal architecture, and South Indian architecture, blends ancient local traditions with imported styles.[399] Vernacular architecture is also regional in its flavours. Vastu shastra, literally \"science of construction\" or \"architecture\" and ascribed to Mamuni Mayan,[400] explores how the laws of nature affect human dwellings;[401] it employs precise geometry and directional alignments to reflect perceived cosmic constructs.[402] As applied in Hindu temple architecture, it is influenced by the Shilpa Shastras, a series of foundational texts whose basic mythological form is the Vastu-Purusha mandala, a square that embodied the \"absolute\".[403] The Taj Mahal, built in Agra between 1631 and 1648 by orders of Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife, has been described in the UNESCO World Heritage List as \"the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world\\'s heritage\".[404] Indo-Saracenic Revival architecture, developed by the British in the late 19th century, drew on Indo-Islamic architecture.[405]\\nThe earliest literature in India, composed between 1500\\xa0BCE and 1200\\xa0CE, was in the Sanskrit language.[406] Major works of Sanskrit literature include the Rigveda (c.\\u20091500\\xa0BCE\\xa0– c.\\u20091200\\xa0BCE), the epics: Mahābhārata ( c.\\u2009400\\xa0BCE\\xa0– c.\\u2009400\\xa0CE) and the Ramayana ( c.\\u2009300\\xa0BCE and later); Abhijñānaśākuntalam (The Recognition of Śakuntalā, and other dramas of Kālidāsa ( c.\\u20095th century\\xa0CE) and Mahākāvya poetry.[407][408][409] In Tamil literature, the Sangam literature ( c.\\u2009600\\xa0BCE\\xa0– c.\\u2009300\\xa0BCE) consisting of 2,381 poems, composed by 473 poets, is the earliest work.[410][411][412][413] From the 14th to the 18th centuries, India\\'s literary traditions went through a period of drastic change because of the emergence of devotional poets like Kabīr, Tulsīdās, and Guru Nānak. This period was characterised by a varied and wide spectrum of thought and expression; as a consequence, medieval Indian literary works differed significantly from classical traditions.[414] In the 19th century, Indian writers took a new interest in social questions and psychological descriptions. In the 20th century, Indian literature was influenced by the works of the Bengali poet, author and philosopher Rabindranath Tagore,[415] who was a recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature.\\nIndian music ranges over various traditions and regional styles. Classical music encompasses two genres and their various folk offshoots: the northern Hindustani and southern Carnatic schools.[416] Regionalised popular forms include filmi and folk music; the syncretic tradition of the bauls is a well-known form of the latter. Indian dance also features diverse folk and classical forms. Among the better-known folk dances are: the bhangra of Punjab, the bihu of Assam, the Jhumair and chhau of Jharkhand, Odisha and West Bengal, garba and dandiya of Gujarat, ghoomar of Rajasthan, and the lavani of Maharashtra. Eight dance forms, many with narrative forms and mythological elements, have been accorded classical dance status by India\\'s National Academy of Music, Dance, and Drama. These are: bharatanatyam of the state of Tamil Nadu, kathak of Uttar Pradesh, kathakali and mohiniyattam of Kerala, kuchipudi of Andhra Pradesh, manipuri of Manipur, odissi of Odisha, and the sattriya of Assam.[417]\\nTheatre in India melds music, dance, and improvised or written dialogue.[418] Often based on Hindu mythology, but also borrowing from medieval romances or social and political events, Indian theatre includes: the bhavai of Gujarat, the jatra of West Bengal, the nautanki and ramlila of North India, tamasha of Maharashtra, burrakatha of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, terukkuttu of Tamil Nadu, and the yakshagana of Karnataka.[419] India has a theatre training institute the National School of Drama (NSD) that is situated at New Delhi It is an autonomous organisation under the Ministry of Culture, Government of India.[420]\\nThe Indian film industry produces the world\\'s most-watched cinema.[421] Established regional cinematic traditions exist in the Assamese, Bengali, Bhojpuri, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Punjabi, Gujarati, Marathi, Odia, Tamil, and Telugu languages.[422] The Hindi language film industry (Bollywood) is the largest sector representing 43% of box office revenue, followed by the South Indian Telugu and Tamil film industries which represent 36% combined.[423]\\nTelevision broadcasting began in India in 1959 as a state-run medium of communication and expanded slowly for more than two decades.[424][425] The state monopoly on television broadcast ended in the 1990s. Since then, satellite channels have increasingly shaped the popular culture of Indian society.[426] Today, television is the most penetrative media in India; industry estimates indicate that as of 2012[update] there are over 554 million TV consumers, 462\\xa0million with satellite or cable connections compared to other forms of mass media such as the press (350\\xa0million), radio (156\\xa0million) or internet (37\\xa0million).[427]\\nTraditional Indian society is sometimes defined by social hierarchy. The Indian caste system embodies much of the social stratification and many of the social restrictions found on the Indian subcontinent. Social classes are defined by thousands of endogamous hereditary groups, often termed as jātis, or \"castes\".[428] India declared untouchability to be illegal[429] in 1947 and has since enacted other anti-discriminatory laws and social welfare initiatives.\\nFamily values are important in the Indian tradition, and multi-generational patrilineal joint families have been the norm in India, though nuclear families are becoming common in urban areas.[430] An overwhelming majority of Indians, with their consent, have their marriages arranged by their parents or other family elders.[431] Marriage is thought to be for life,[431] and the divorce rate is extremely low,[432] with less than one in a thousand marriages ending in divorce.[433] Child marriages are common, especially in rural areas; many women wed before reaching 18, which is their legal marriageable age.[434] Female infanticide in India, and lately female foeticide, have created skewed gender ratios; the number of missing women in the country quadrupled from 15 million to 63 million in the 50-year period ending in 2014, faster than the population growth during the same period, and constituting 20 percent of India\\'s female electorate.[435] Accord to an Indian government study, an additional 21 million girls are unwanted and do not receive adequate care.[436] Despite a government ban on sex-selective foeticide, the practice remains commonplace in India, the result of a preference for boys in a patriarchal society.[437] The payment of dowry, although illegal, remains widespread across class lines.[438] Deaths resulting from dowry, mostly from bride burning, are on the rise, despite stringent anti-dowry laws.[439]\\nMany Indian festivals are religious in origin. The best known include: Diwali, Ganesh Chaturthi, Thai Pongal, Holi, Durga Puja, Eid ul-Fitr, Bakr-Id, Christmas, and Vaisakhi.[440][441]\\nIn the 2011 census, about 73% of the population was literate, with 81% for men and 65% for women. This compares to 1981 when the respective rates were 41%, 53% and 29%. In 1951 the rates were 18%, 27% and 9%. In 1921 the rates 7%, 12% and 2%. In 1891 they were 5%, 9% and 1%,[442][443] According to Latika Chaudhary, in 1911 there were under three primary schools for every ten villages. Statistically, more caste and religious diversity reduced private spending. Primary schools taught literacy, so local diversity limited its growth.[444]\\nEducation system of India is the world\\'s second largest higher education System.[445] India had over 900 universities, 40,000 colleges[446] and 1.5 million schools.[447] In India\\'s higher education system, a significant number of seats are reserved under affirmative action policies for the historically disadvantaged. In recent decades India\\'s improved education system is often cited as one of the main contributors to its economic development.[448][449]\\nFrom ancient times until the advent of the modern, the most widely worn traditional dress in India  was draped.[450] For women it took the form of a sari, a single piece of cloth many yards long.[450] The sari was traditionally wrapped around the lower body and the shoulder.[450] In its modern form, it is combined with an underskirt, or Indian petticoat, and tucked in the waist band for more secure fastening. It is also commonly worn with an Indian blouse, or choli, which serves as the primary upper-body garment, the sari\\'s end—passing over the shoulder—serving to cover the midriff and obscure the upper body\\'s contours.[450] For men, a similar but shorter length of cloth, the dhoti, has served as a lower-body garment.[451]\\nThe use of stitched clothes became widespread after Muslim rule was established at first by the Delhi sultanate (ca 1300 CE) and then continued by the Mughal Empire (ca 1525 CE).[452] Among the garments introduced during this time and still commonly worn are: the shalwars and pyjamas, both styles of trousers, and the tunics kurta and kameez.[452] In southern India, the traditional draped garments were to see much longer continuous use.[452]\\nShalwars are atypically wide at the waist but narrow to a cuffed bottom. They are held up by a drawstring, which causes them to become pleated around the waist.[453] The pants can be wide and baggy, or they can be cut quite narrow, on the bias, in which case they are called churidars. When they are ordinarily wide at the waist and their bottoms are hemmed but not cuffed, they are called pyjamas. The kameez is a long shirt or tunic,[454] its side seams left open below the waist-line.[455]  The kurta is traditionally collarless and made of cotton or silk; it is worn plain or with embroidered decoration, such as chikan; and typically falls to either just above or just below the wearer\\'s knees.[456]\\nIn the last 50 years, fashions have changed a great deal in India. Increasingly, in urban northern India, the sari is no longer the apparel of everyday wear, though they remain popular on formal occasions.[457] The traditional shalwar kameez is rarely worn by younger urban women, who favour churidars or jeans.[457]  In white-collar office settings, ubiquitous air conditioning allows men to wear sports jackets year-round.[457] For weddings and formal occasions, men in the middle- and upper classes often wear bandgala, or short Nehru jackets, with pants, with the groom and his groomsmen sporting sherwanis and churidars.[457] The dhoti, once the universal garment of Hindu males, the wearing of which in the homespun and handwoven khadi allowed Gandhi to bring Indian nationalism to the millions,[458]\\nis seldom seen in the cities.[457]\\nThe foundation of a typical Indian meal is a cereal cooked in a plain fashion and complemented with flavourful savoury dishes.[459] The cooked cereal could be steamed rice; chapati, a thin unleavened bread made from wheat flour, or occasionally cornmeal, and griddle-cooked dry;[460] the idli, a steamed breakfast cake, or  dosa, a griddled pancake, both leavened and made from a batter of rice- and gram meal.[461]  The savoury dishes might include lentils, pulses and vegetables commonly spiced with ginger and garlic, but also with a combination of spices that may include coriander, cumin, turmeric, cinnamon, cardamon and others as informed by culinary conventions.[459] They might also include poultry, fish, or meat dishes. In some instances, the ingredients might be mixed during the process of cooking.[462]\\nA platter, or thali, used for eating usually has a central place reserved for the cooked cereal, and peripheral ones for the flavourful accompaniments, which are often served in small bowls. The cereal and its accompaniments are eaten simultaneously rather than a piecemeal manner.  This is accomplished by mixing—for example of rice and lentils—or  folding, wrapping, scooping or dipping—such as chapati and cooked vegetables or lentils.[459]\\nIndia has distinctive vegetarian cuisines, each a feature of the geographical and cultural histories of its adherents.[464] The appearance of ahimsa, or the avoidance of violence toward all forms of life in many religious orders early in Indian history, especially Upanishadic Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism, is thought to have contributed to the predominance of vegetarianism among a large segment of India\\'s Hindu population, especially in southern India, Gujarat, the Hindi-speaking belt of north-central India, as well as among Jains.[464]  Although meat is eaten widely in India,  the proportional consumption of meat in the overall diet is low.[465] Unlike China, which has increased its per capita meat consumption substantially in its years of increased economic growth, in India the strong dietary traditions have contributed to dairy, rather than meat, becoming the preferred form of animal protein consumption.[466]\\nThe most significant import of cooking techniques into India during the last millennium occurred during the Mughal Empire. Dishes such as the pilaf,[467] developed in the Abbasid caliphate,[468] and cooking techniques such as the marinating of meat in yogurt, spread into northern India from regions to its northwest.[469]  In the food served in Indian restaurants worldwide the diversity of Indian food has been partially concealed by the dominance of Punjabi cuisine. The popularity of tandoori chicken—cooked in the tandoor oven, which had traditionally been used for baking bread in the rural Punjab and the Delhi region, especially among Muslims, but which is originally from Central Asia—dates to the 1950s, and was caused in large part by an entrepreneurial response among people from the Punjab who had been displaced by the 1947 partition of India.[464]\\nCricket is the most popular sport in India.[470] Major domestic competitions include the Indian Premier League, which is the most-watched cricket league in the world and ranks sixth among all sports leagues.[471] Other professional leagues include the pro football and the pro Kabaddi leagues.[472][473][474]\\nIndia has won two Cricket world cups and has eight field hockey gold medals in the summer olympics[475]\\n\\nSeveral traditional indigenous sports remain fairly popular, such as kabaddi, kho kho, pehlwani and gilli-danda. Some of the earliest forms of Asian martial arts, such as Kalarippayattu, musti yuddha,[dubious  – discuss] silambam, and marma adi, originated in India. Chess, commonly held to have originated in India as chaturaṅga, is regaining widespread popularity with the rise in the number of Indian grandmasters.[476][477] Pachisi, from which parcheesi derives, was played on a giant marble court by Akbar.[478]\\nThe improved results garnered by the Indian Davis Cup team and other Indian tennis players in the early 2010s have made tennis increasingly popular in the country.[479] India has a comparatively strong presence in shooting sports, and has won several medals at the Olympics, the World Shooting Championships, and the Commonwealth Games.[480][481] Other sports in which Indians have succeeded internationally include badminton[482] (Saina Nehwal and P V Sindhu are two of the top-ranked female badminton players in the world), boxing,[483] and wrestling.[484] Football is popular in West Bengal, Goa, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and the north-eastern states.[485]\\nIndia has hosted or co-hosted several international sporting events: the 1951 and 1982 Asian Games; the 1987, 1996, and 2011 Cricket World Cup tournaments; the 2003 Afro-Asian Games; the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy; the 2009 World Badminton Championships; the 2010 Hockey World Cup; the 2010 Commonwealth Games; and the 2017 FIFA U-17 World Cup. Major international sporting events held annually in India include the Maharashtra Open, the Mumbai Marathon, the Delhi Half Marathon, and the Indian Masters. The first Formula 1 Indian Grand Prix featured in late 2011 but has been discontinued from the F1 season calendar since 2014.[487] India has traditionally been the dominant country at the South Asian Games. An example of this dominance is the basketball competition where the Indian team won three out of four tournaments to date.[488]\\n\\nOverview\\nEtymology\\nHistory\\nGeography\\nBiodiversity\\nPolitics\\nForeign relations and military\\nEconomy\\nDemographics\\nArt\\nCulture\\nGovernment\\nGeneral information\\nCoordinates: 21°N 78°E\\ufeff / \\ufeff21°N 78°E\\ufeff / 21; 78\\n'"

kingdoms of Southeast Asia   In the early medieval era  Christianity  Islam  Judaism  and Zoroastrianism put down roots on India s southern and western coasts   Muslim armies from Central Asia intermittently overran India s northern plains   eventually establishing the Delhi Sultanate  and drawing northern India into the cosmopolitan networks of medieval Islam   In the   th century  the

British Indian Empire was partitioned into two independent dominions  a Hindu majority Dominion of India and a Muslim majority Dominion of Pakistan  amid large scale loss of life and an unprecedented migration    India has been a federal republic since       governed in a democratic parliamentary system  It is a pluralistic  multilingual and multi ethnic society  India s population grew from

among these forests  and elsewhere  in protected habitats  According to the Oxford English Dictionary  third edition        the name  India  is derived from the Classical Latin India  a reference to South Asia and an uncertain region to its east  and in turn derived successively from  Hellenistic Greek India           ancient Greek Indos           Old Persian Hindush  an eastern province of the Achaemenid empire  and ultimately its cognate  the Sanskrit Sindhu  or  river   specifically the Indus River and  by implication  its well settled southern basin    The ancient Greeks referred to the

mid   th century as a native name for India    Hindustan     nd  sta n   listen   is a Middle Persian name for India  introduced during the Mughal Empire and used widely since  Its meaning has varied  referring to a region encompassing present day northern India and Pakistan or to India in its near entirety     By        years ago  the first modern humans  or Homo sapiens  had arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa  where they had earlier evolved     The earliest known modern human remains in South Asia date to about        years ago   After      BCE  evidence for domestication of food crops and animals  construction of permanent structures  and storage of agricultural surplus appeared in Mehrgarh and other sites in what is now Balochistan  Pakistan   These gradually developed into the Indus Valley Civilisation    the first urban culture in South Asia   which flourished during           BCE in what is now Pakistan and western India   Centred around cities such as Mohenjo daro  Harappa  Dholavira  and Kalibangan  and relying on varied forms of subsistence  the civilisation engaged robustly in crafts production and wide ranging trade   During the period          BCE  many regions of the subcontinent transitioned from the Chalcolithic cultures to the Iron Age ones   The Vedas  the oldest scriptures associated with Hinduism   were composed during this period   and historians have analysed these to posit a Vedic culture in the Punjab region and the upper Gangetic Plain   Most historians also consider this period to have encompassed several waves of Indo Aryan migration into the subcontinent from the north west   The caste system  which created a hierarchy of priests  warriors  and free peasants  but which excluded indigenous peoples by labelling their occupations impure  arose during this period   On the Deccan Plateau  archaeological evidence from this period suggests the existence of a chiefdom stage of political organisation   In South India  a progression to sedentary life is indicated by the large number of megalithic monuments dating from this period   as well as by nearby traces of agriculture  irrigation tanks  and craft traditions   In the late Vedic period  around the  th century BCE  the small states and chiefdoms of the Ganges Plain and the north western regions had consolidated into    major oligarchies and monarchies that were known as the mahajanapadas    The emerging urbanisation gave rise to non Vedic religious movements  two of which became independent religions  Jainism came into prominence during the life of its exemplar  Mahavira   Buddhism  based on the teachings of Gautama Buddha  attracted followers from all social classes excepting the middle class  chronicling the life of the Buddha was central to the beginnings of recorded history in India     In an age of increasing urban wealth  both religions held up renunciation as an ideal   and both established long lasting monastic traditions  Politically  by the  rd century BCE  the kingdom of Magadha had annexed or reduced other states to emerge as the Mauryan Empire   The empire was once thought to have controlled most of the subcontinent except the far south  but its core regions are now thought to have been separated by large autonomous areas    The Mauryan kings are known as much for their empire building and determined management of public life as for Ashoka s renunciation of militarism and far flung advocacy of the Buddhist dhamma    The Sangam literature of the Tamil language reveals that  between     BCE and     CE  the southern peninsula was ruled by the Cheras  the Cholas  and the Pandyas  dynasties that traded extensively with the Roman Empire and with West and South East Asia    In North India  Hinduism asserted patriarchal control within the family  leading to increased subordination of women    By the  th and  th centuries  the Gupta Empire had created a complex system of administration and taxation in the greater Ganges Plain  this system became a model for later Indian kingdoms    Under the Guptas  a renewed Hinduism based on devotion  rather than the management of ritual  began to assert itself   This renewal was reflected in a flowering of sculpture and architecture  which found patrons among an urban elite   Classical Sanskrit literature flowered as well  and Indian science  astronomy  medicine  and mathematics made significant advances   The Indian early medieval age  from     to      CE  is defined by regional kingdoms and cultural diversity   When Harsha of Kannauj  who ruled much of the Indo Gangetic Plain from     to     CE  attempted to expand southwards  he was defeated by the Chalukya ruler of the Deccan   When his successor attempted to expand eastwards  he was defeated by the Pala king of Bengal   When the Chalukyas attempted to expand southwards  they were defeated by the Pallavas from farther south  who in turn were opposed by the Pandyas and the Cholas from still farther south   No ruler of this period was able to create an empire and consistently control lands much beyond their core region   During this time  pastoral peoples  whose land had been cleared to make way for the growing agricultural economy  were accommodated within caste society  as were new non traditional ruling classes   The caste system consequently began to show regional differences   In the  th and  th centuries  the first devotional hymns were created in the Tamil language   They were imitated all over India and led to both the resurgence of Hinduism and the development of all modern languages of the subcontinent   Indian royalty  big and small  and the temples they patronised drew citizens in great numbers to the capital cities  which became economic hubs as well   Temple towns of various sizes began to appear everywhere as India underwent another urbanisation   By the  th and  th centuries  the effects were felt in South East Asia  as South Indian culture and political systems were exported to lands that became part of modern day Myanmar  Thailand  Laos  Cambodia  Vietnam  Philippines  Malaysia  and Java   Indian merchants  scholars  and sometimes armies were involved in this transmission  South East Asians took the initiative as well  with many sojourning in Indian seminaries and translating Buddhist and Hindu texts into their languages   After the   th century  Muslim Central Asian nomadic clans  using swift horse cavalry and raising vast armies united by ethnicity and religion  repeatedly overran South Asia s north western plains  leading eventually to the establishment of the Islamic Delhi Sultanate in        The sultanate was to control much of North India and to make many forays into South India  Although at first disruptive for the Indian elites  the sultanate largely left its vast non Muslim subject population to its own laws and customs    By repeatedly repulsing Mongol raiders in the   th century  the sultanate saved India from the devastation visited on West and Central Asia  setting the scene for centuries of migration of fleeing soldiers  learned men  mystics  traders  artists  and artisans from that region into the subcontinent  thereby creating a syncretic Indo Islamic culture in the north    The sultanate s raiding and weakening of the regional kingdoms of South India paved the way for the indigenous Vijayanagara Empire   Embracing a strong Shaivite tradition and building upon the military technology of the sultanate  the empire came to control much of peninsular India   and was to influence South Indian society for long afterwards   In the early   th century  northern India  then under mainly Muslim rulers   fell again to the superior mobility and firepower of a new generation of Central Asian warriors   The resulting Mughal Empire did not stamp out the local societies it came to rule  Instead  it balanced and pacified them through new administrative practices   and diverse and inclusive ruling elites   leading to more systematic  centralised  and uniform rule   Eschewing tribal bonds and Islamic identity  especially under Akbar  the Mughals united their far flung realms through loyalty  expressed through a Persianised culture  to an emperor who had near divine status   The Mughal state s economic policies  deriving most revenues from agriculture  and mandating that taxes be paid in the well regulated silver currency   caused peasants and artisans to enter larger markets   The relative peace maintained by the empire during much of the   th century was a factor in India s economic expansion   resulting in greater patronage of painting  literary forms  textiles  and architecture   Newly coherent social groups in northern and western India  such as the Marathas  the Rajputs  and the Sikhs  gained military and governing ambitions during Mughal rule  which  through collaboration or adversity  gave them both recognition and military experience   Expanding commerce during Mughal rule gave rise to new Indian commercial and political elites along the coasts of southern and eastern India   As the empire disintegrated  many among these elites were able to seek and control their own affairs   By the early   th century  with the lines between commercial and political dominance being increasingly blurred  a number of European trading companies  including the English East India Company  had established coastal outposts    The East India Company s control of the seas  greater resources  and more advanced military training and technology led it to increasingly assert its military strength and caused it to become attractive to a portion of the Indian elite  these factors were crucial in allowing the company to gain control over the Bengal region by      and sideline the other European companies      Its further access to the riches of Bengal and the subsequent increased strength and size of its army enabled it to annexe or subdue most of India by the     s   India was then no longer exporting manufactured goods as it long had  but was instead supplying the British Empire with raw materials  Many historians consider this to be the onset of India s colonial period   By this time  with its economic power severely curtailed by the British parliament and having effectively been made an arm of British administration  the company began more consciously to enter non economic arenas like education  social reform  and culture   Historians consider India s modern age to have begun sometime between      and       The appointment in      of Lord Dalhousie as Governor General of the East India Company set the stage for changes essential to a modern state  These included the consolidation and demarcation of sovereignty  the surveillance of the population  and the education of citizens  Technological changes among them  railways  canals  and the telegraph were introduced not long after their introduction in Europe      However  disaffection with the company also grew during this time and set off the Indian Rebellion of       Fed by diverse resentments and perceptions  including invasive British style social reforms  harsh land taxes  and summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes  the rebellion rocked many regions of northern and central India and shook the foundations of Company rule    Although the rebellion was suppressed by       it led to the dissolution of the East India Company and the direct administration of India by the British government  Proclaiming a unitary state and a gradual but limited British style parliamentary system  the new rulers also protected princes and landed gentry as a feudal safeguard against future unrest    In the decades following  public life gradually emerged all over India  leading eventually to the founding of the Indian National Congress in           The rush of technology and the commercialisation of agriculture in the second half of the   th century was marked by economic setbacks and many small farmers became dependent on the whims of far away markets   There was an increase in the number of large scale famines   and  despite the risks of infrastructure development borne by Indian taxpayers  little industrial employment was generated for Indians   There were also salutary effects  commercial cropping  especially in the newly canalled Punjab  led to increased food production for internal consumption   The railway network provided critical famine relief   notably reduced the cost of moving goods   and helped nascent Indian owned industry   After World War I  in which approximately one million Indians served   a new period began  It was marked by British reforms but also repressive legislation  by more strident Indian calls for self rule  and by the beginnings of a nonviolent movement of non co operation  of which Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi would become the leader and enduring symbol   During the     s  slow legislative reform was enacted by the British  the Indian National Congress won victories in the resulting elections   The next decade was beset with crises  Indian participation in World War II  the Congress s final push for non co operation  and an upsurge of Muslim nationalism  All were capped by the advent of independence in       but tempered by the partition of India into two states  India and Pakistan   Vital to India s self image as an independent nation was its constitution  completed in       which put in place a secular and democratic republic   It has remained a democracy with civil liberties  an active Supreme Court  and a largely independent press   Economic liberalisation  which began in the     s  has created a large urban middle class  transformed India into one of the world s fastest growing economies   and increased its geopolitical clout  Indian movies  music  and spiritual teachings play an increasing role in global culture   Yet  India is also shaped by seemingly unyielding poverty  both rural and urban   by religious and caste related violence   by Maoist inspired Naxalite insurgencies   and by separatism in Jammu and Kashmir and in Northeast India   It has unresolved territorial disputes with China  and with Pakistan   India s sustained democratic freedoms are unique among the world s newer nations  however  in spite of its recent economic successes  freedom from want for its disadvantaged population remains a goal yet to be achieved   India accounts for the bulk of the Indian subcontinent  lying atop the Indian tectonic plate  a part of the Indo Australian Plate   India s defining geological processes began    million years ago when the Indian Plate  then part of the southern supercontinent Gondwana  began a north eastward drift caused by seafloor spreading to its south west  and later  south and south east   Simultaneously  the vast Tethyan oceanic crust  to its northeast  began to subduct under the Eurasian Plate   These dual processes  driven by convection in the Earth s mantle  both created the Indian Ocean and caused the Indian continental crust eventually to under thrust Eurasia and to uplift the Himalayas   Immediately south of the emerging Himalayas  plate movement created a vast trough that rapidly filled with river borne sediment  and now constitutes the Indo Gangetic Plain   Cut off from the plain by the ancient Aravalli Range lies the Thar Desert   The original Indian Plate survives as peninsular India  the oldest and geologically most stable part of India  It extends as far north as the Satpura and Vindhya ranges in central India  These parallel chains run from the Arabian Sea coast in Gujarat in the west to the coal rich Chota Nagpur Plateau in Jharkhand in the east   To the south  the remaining peninsular landmass  the Deccan Plateau  is flanked on the west and east by coastal ranges known as the Western and Eastern Ghats   the plateau contains the country s oldest rock formations  some over one billion years old  Constituted in such fashion  India lies to the north of the equator between        and         north latitude i  and        and         east longitude   India s coastline measures       kilometres        mi  in length  of this distance        kilometres        mi  belong to peninsular India and       kilometres        mi  to the Andaman  Nicobar  and Lakshadweep island chains   According to the Indian naval hydrographic charts  the mainland coastline consists of the following      sandy beaches      rocky shores  including cliffs  and     mudflats or marshy shores   Major Himalayan origin rivers that substantially flow through India include the Ganges and the Brahmaputra  both of which drain into the Bay of Bengal   Important tributaries of the Ganges include the Yamuna and the Kosi  the latter s extremely low gradient  caused by long term silt deposition  leads to severe floods and course changes    Major peninsular rivers  whose steeper gradients prevent their waters from flooding  include the Godavari  the Mahanadi  the Kaveri  and the Krishna  which also drain into the Bay of Bengal   and the Narmada and the Tapti  which drain into the Arabian Sea   Coastal features include the marshy Rann of Kutch of western India and the alluvial Sundarbans delta of eastern India  the latter is shared with Bangladesh   India has two archipelagos  the Lakshadweep  coral atolls off India s south western coast  and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands  a volcanic chain in the Andaman Sea   The Indian climate is strongly influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert  both of which drive the economically and culturally pivotal summer and winter monsoons   The Himalayas prevent cold Central Asian katabatic winds from blowing in  keeping the bulk of the Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations at similar latitudes    The Thar Desert plays a crucial role in attracting the moisture laden south west summer monsoon winds that  between June and October  provide the majority of India s rainfall   Four major climatic groupings predominate in India  tropical wet  tropical dry  subtropical humid  and montane   Temperatures in India have risen by      C       F  between      and        Climate change in India is often thought to be the cause  The retreat of Himalayan glaciers has adversely affected the flow rate of the major Himalayan rivers  including the Ganges and the Brahmaputra   According to some current projections  the number and severity of droughts in India will have markedly increased by the end of the present century   India is a megadiverse country  a term employed for    countries which display high biological diversity and contain many species exclusively indigenous  or endemic  to them   India is a habitat for      of all mammal species        of bird species       of reptile species     of amphibian species        of fish species  and      of all flowering plant species    Fully a third of Indian plant species are endemic   India also contains four of the world s    biodiversity hotspots   or regions that display significant habitat loss in the presence of high endemism  j   India s forest cover is        km          sq mi   which is        of the country s total land area   It can be subdivided further into broad categories of canopy density  or the proportion of the area of a forest covered by its tree canopy   Very dense forest  whose canopy density is greater than      occupies       of India s land area    It predominates in the tropical moist forest of the Andaman Islands  the Western Ghats  and Northeast India   Moderately dense forest  whose canopy density is between     and      occupies       of India s land area    It predominates in the temperate coniferous forest of the Himalayas  the moist deciduous sal forest of eastern India  and the dry deciduous teak forest of central and southern India   Open forest  whose canopy density is between     and      occupies       of India s land area    and predominates in the babul dominated thorn forest of the central Deccan Plateau and the western Gangetic plain   Among the Indian subcontinent s notable indigenous trees are the astringent Azadirachta indica  or neem  which is widely used in rural Indian herbal medicine   and the luxuriant Ficus religiosa  or peepul   which is displayed on the ancient seals of Mohenjo daro   and under which the Buddha is recorded in the Pali canon to have sought enlightenment   Many Indian species have descended from those of Gondwana  the southern supercontinent from which India separated more than     million years ago   India s subsequent collision with Eurasia set off a mass exchange of species  However  volcanism and climatic changes later caused the extinction of many endemic Indian forms   Still later  mammals entered India from Asia through two zoogeographical passes flanking the Himalayas   This had the effect of lowering endemism among India s mammals  which stands at        contrasting with       among reptiles and       among amphibians   Notable endemics are the vulnerable  hooded leaf monkey  and the threatened  Beddom s toad   of the Western Ghats  India contains     IUCN designated threatened animal species  or      of endangered forms   These include the endangered Bengal tiger and the Ganges river dolphin  Critically endangered species include  the gharial  a crocodilian  the great Indian bustard  and the Indian white rumped vulture  which has become nearly extinct by having ingested the carrion of diclofenac treated cattle   The pervasive and ecologically devastating human encroachment of recent decades has critically endangered Indian wildlife  In response  the system of national parks and protected areas  first established in       was expanded substantially  In       India enacted the Wildlife Protection Act  and Project Tiger to safeguard crucial wilderness  the Forest Conservation Act was enacted in      and amendments added in        India hosts more than five hundred wildlife sanctuaries and thirteen biosphere reserves   four of which are part of the World Network of Biosphere Reserves  twenty five wetlands are registered under the Ramsar Convention   India is the world s most populous democracy   A parliamentary republic with a multi party system   it has eight recognised national parties  including the Indian National Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party  BJP   and more than    regional parties   The Congress is considered centre left in Indian political culture   and the BJP right wing     For most of the period between      when India first became a republic and the late     s  the Congress held a majority in the parliament  Since then  however  it has increasingly shared the political stage with the BJP   as well as with powerful regional parties which have often forced the creation of multi party coalition governments at the centre   In the Republic of India s first three general elections  in             and       the Jawaharlal Nehru led Congress won easy victories  On Nehru s death in       Lal Bahadur Shastri briefly became prime minister  he was succeeded  after his own unexpected death in       by Nehru s daughter Indira Gandhi  who went on to lead the Congress to election victories in      and       Following public discontent with the state of emergency she declared in       the Congress was voted out of power in       the then new Janata Party  which had opposed the emergency  was voted in  Its government lasted just over two years  Voted back into power in       the Congress saw a change in leadership in       when Indira Gandhi was assassinated  she was succeeded by her son Rajiv Gandhi  who won an easy victory in the general elections later that year  The Congress was voted out again in      when a National Front coalition  led by the newly formed Janata Dal in alliance with the Left Front  won the elections  that government too proved relatively short lived  lasting just under two years   Elections were held again in       no party won an absolute majority  The Congress  as the largest single party  was able to form a minority government led by P  V  Narasimha Rao   A two year period of political turmoil followed the general election of       Several short lived alliances shared power at the centre  The BJP formed a government briefly in       it was followed by two comparatively long lasting United Front coalitions  which depended on external support  In       the BJP was able to form a successful coalition  the National Democratic Alliance  NDA   Led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee  the NDA became the first non Congress  coalition government to complete a five year term   Again in the      Indian general elections  no party won an absolute majority  but the Congress emerged as the largest single party  forming another successful coalition  the United Progressive Alliance  UPA   It had the support of left leaning parties and MPs who opposed the BJP  The UPA returned to power in the      general election with increased numbers  and it no longer required external support from India s communist parties   That year  Manmohan Singh became the first prime minister since Jawaharlal Nehru in      and      to be re elected to a consecutive five year term   In the      general election  the BJP became the first political party since      to win a majority and govern without the support of other parties   The incumbent prime minister is Narendra Modi  a former chief minister of Gujarat  On    July       Ram Nath Kovind was elected India s   th president and took the oath of office on    July          India is a federation with a parliamentary system governed under the Constitution of India the country s supreme legal document  It is a constitutional republic and representative democracy  in which  majority rule is tempered by minority rights protected by law   Federalism in India defines the power distribution between the union and the states  The Constitution of India  which came into effect on    January        originally stated India to be a  sovereign  democratic republic   this characterisation was amended in      to  a sovereign  socialist  secular  democratic republic    India s form of government  traditionally described as  quasi federal  with a strong centre and weak states   has grown increasingly federal since the late     s as a result of political  economic  and social changes    The Government of India comprises three branches   India is a federal union comprising    states and   union territories  listed below as      and A H  respectively    All states  as well as the union territories of Jammu and Kashmir  Puducherry and the National Capital Territory of Delhi  have elected legislatures and governments following the Westminster system of governance  The remaining five union territories are directly ruled by the central government through appointed administrators  In       under the States Reorganisation Act  states were reorganised on a linguistic basis   There are over a quarter of a million local government bodies at city  town  block  district and village levels   In the     s  India strongly supported decolonisation in Africa and Asia and played a leading role in the Non Aligned Movement   After initially cordial relations with neighbouring China  India went to war with China in       and was widely thought to have been humiliated   India has had tense relations with neighbouring Pakistan  the two nations have gone to war four times  in                   and       Three of these wars were fought over the disputed territory of Kashmir  while the fourth  the      war  followed from India s support for the independence of Bangladesh   In the late     s  the Indian military twice intervened abroad at the invitation of the host country  a peace keeping operation in Sri Lanka between      and       and an armed intervention to prevent a      coup d  tat attempt in the Maldives  After the      war with Pakistan  India began to pursue close military and economic ties with the Soviet Union  by the late     s  the Soviet Union was its largest arms supplier   Aside from ongoing its special relationship with Russia   India has wide ranging defence relations with Israel and France  In recent years  it has played key roles in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation and the World Trade Organization  The nation has provided         military and police personnel to serve in    UN peacekeeping operations across four continents  It participates in the East Asia Summit  the G     and other multilateral forums   India has close economic ties with countries in South America   Asia  and Africa  it pursues a  Look East  policy that seeks to strengthen partnerships with the ASEAN nations  Japan  and South Korea that revolve around many issues  but especially those involving economic investment and regional security    China s nuclear test of       as well as its repeated threats to intervene in support of Pakistan in the      war  convinced India to develop nuclear weapons   India conducted its first nuclear weapons test in      and carried out additional underground testing in       Despite criticism and military sanctions  India has signed neither the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty nor the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty  considering both to be flawed and discriminatory   India maintains a  no first use  nuclear policy and is developing a nuclear triad capability as a part of its  Minimum Credible Deterrence  doctrine    It is developing a ballistic missile defence shield and  a fifth generation fighter jet    Other indigenous military projects involve the design and implementation of Vikrant class aircraft carriers and Arihant class nuclear submarines   Since the end of the Cold War  India has increased its economic  strategic  and military co operation with the United States and the European Union   In       a civilian nuclear agreement was signed between India and the United States  Although India possessed nuclear weapons at the time and was not a party to the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty  it received waivers from the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Nuclear Suppliers Group  ending earlier restrictions on India s nuclear technology and commerce  As a consequence  India became the sixth de facto nuclear weapons state   India subsequently signed co operation agreements involving civilian nuclear energy with Russia   France   the United Kingdom   and Canada   The President of India is the supreme commander of the nation s armed forces  with      million active troops  they compose the world s second largest military  It comprises the Indian Army  the Indian Navy  the Indian Air Force  and the Indian Coast Guard   The official Indian defence budget for      was US       billion  or       of GDP   For the fiscal year spanning            US       billion was budgeted   According to a      Stockholm International Peace Research Institute  SIPRI  report  India s annual military expenditure in terms of purchasing power stood at US      billion   In       the annual defence budget increased by         although this does not include funds that reach the military through other branches of government   As of      update   India is the world s largest arms importer  between      and       it accounted for     of funds spent on international arms purchases   Much of the military expenditure was focused on defence against Pakistan and countering growing Chinese influence in the Indian Ocean   In May       the Indian Space Research Organisation launched the South Asia Satellite  a gift from India to its neighbouring SAARC countries   In October       India signed a US      billion  over      billion  agreement with Russia to procure four S     Triumf surface to air missile defence systems  Russia s most advanced long range missile defence system   According to the International Monetary Fund  IMF   the Indian economy in      was nominally worth

th in GDP per capita at PPP   Until       all Indian governments followed protectionist policies that were influenced by socialist economics  Widespread state intervention and regulation largely walled the economy off from the outside world  An acute balance of payments crisis in      forced the nation to liberalise its economy   since then it has moved slowly towards a free market system

   The human sex ratio  according to the      census  is     females per       males   The median age was      as of      update    The first post colonial census  conducted in       counted     million people   Medical advances made in the last    years as well as increased agricultural productivity brought about by the  Green Revolution  have caused India s population to grow rapidly   The average life expectancy in India is at    years      years for women       years for men   There are around    physicians per         Indians   Migration from rural to urban areas has been an important dynamic in India s recent history  The number of people living in urban areas grew by       between      and        Yet  in       over     still lived in rural areas    The level of urbanisation increased further from        in the      Census to        in the      Census  The slowing down of the overall population growth rate was due to the sharp decline in the growth rate in rural areas since        According to the      census  there are    million plus urban agglomerations in India  among them Mumbai  Delhi  Kolkata  Chennai  Bangalore  Hyderabad and Ahmedabad  in decreasing order by population   The literacy rate in      was                among females and        among males   The rural urban literacy gap  which was      percentage points in       dropped to      percentage points in       The improvement in the rural literacy rate is twice that of urban areas   Kerala is the most literate state with        literacy  while Bihar the least with          India is home to two major language families  Indo Aryan  spoken by about     of the population  and Dravidian  spoken by     of the population   Other languages spoken in India come from the Austroasiatic and Sino Tibetan language families  India has no national language   Hindi  with the largest number of speakers  is the official language of the government    English is used extensively in business and administration and has the status of a  subsidiary official language    it is important in education  especially as a medium of higher education  Each state and union territory has one or more official languages  and the constitution recognises in particular     scheduled languages   The      census reported the religion in India with the largest number of followers was Hinduism         of the population   followed by Islam           the remaining were Christianity          Sikhism          Buddhism          Jainism         and others m           India has the third largest Muslim population the largest for a non Muslim majority country    Indian cultural history spans more than       years   During the Vedic period  c       BCE   c      BCE   the foundations of Hindu philosophy  mythology  theology and literature were laid  and many beliefs and practices which still exist today  such as dh rma  k rma  y ga  and mok a  were established   India is notable for its religious diversity  with Hinduism  Buddhism  Sikhism  Islam  Christianity  and Jainism among the nation s major religions   The predominant religion  Hinduism  has been shaped by various historical schools of thought  including those of the Upanishads   the Yoga Sutras  the Bhakti movement   and by Buddhist philosophy   South Asia has an ancient tradition of art  which has exchanged influences with the parts of Eurasia  Seals from the third millennium BCE Indus Valley Civilization of Pakistan and northern India have been found  usually carved with animals  but a few with human figures  The  Pashupati  seal  excavated in Mohenjo daro  Pakistan  in          is the best known    After this there is a long period with virtually nothing surviving    Almost all surviving ancient Indian art thereafter is in various forms of religious sculpture in durable materials  or coins  There was probably originally far more in wood  which is lost  In north India Mauryan art is the first imperial movement     In the first millennium CE  Buddhist art spread with Indian religions to Central  East and South East Asia  the last also greatly influenced by Hindu art   Over the following centuries a distinctly Indian style of sculpting the human figure developed  with less interest in articulating precise anatomy than ancient Greek sculpture but showing smoothly flowing forms expressing prana   breath  or life force     This is often complicated by the need to give figures multiple arms or heads  or represent different genders on the left and right of figures  as with the Ardhanarishvara form of Shiva and Parvati    Most of the earliest large sculpture is Buddhist  either excavated from Buddhist stupas such as Sanchi  Sarnath and Amaravati   or is rock cut reliefs at sites such as Ajanta  Karla and Ellora  Hindu and Jain sites appear rather later    In spite of this complex mixture of religious traditions  generally  the prevailing artistic style at any time and place has been shared by the major religious groups  and sculptors probably usually served all communities   Gupta art  at its peak c      CE   c      CE  is often regarded as a classical period whose influence lingered for many centuries after  it saw a new dominance of Hindu sculpture  as at the Elephanta Caves    Across the north  this became rather stiff and formulaic after c      CE  though rich with finely carved detail in the surrounds of statues   But in the South  under the Pallava and Chola dynasties  sculpture in both stone and bronze had a sustained period of great achievement  the large bronzes with Shiva as Nataraja have become an iconic symbol of India    Ancient painting has only survived at a few sites  of which the crowded scenes of court life in the Ajanta Caves are by far the most important  but it was evidently highly developed  and is mentioned as a courtly accomplishment in Gupta times    Painted manuscripts of religious texts survive from Eastern India about the   th century onwards  most of the earliest being Buddhist and later Jain  No doubt the style of these was used in larger paintings   The Persian derived Deccan painting  starting just before the Mughal miniature  between them give the first large body of secular painting  with an emphasis on portraits  and the recording of princely pleasures and wars    The style spread to Hindu courts  especially among the Rajputs  and developed a variety of styles  with the smaller courts often the most innovative  with figures such as Nih l Chand and Nainsukh    As a market developed among European residents  it was supplied by Company painting by Indian artists with considerable Western influence    In the   th century  cheap Kalighat paintings of gods and everyday life  done on paper  were urban folk art from Calcutta  which later saw the Bengal School of Art  reflecting the art colleges founded by the British  the first movement in modern Indian painting    Bhutesvara Yakshis  Buddhist reliefs from Mathura   nd century CE Gupta terracotta relief  Krishna Killing the Horse Demon Keshi   th century Elephanta Caves  triple bust  trimurti  of Shiva     feet      m  tall  c      Jahangir Receives Prince Khurram at Ajmer on His Return from the Mewar Campaign  Balchand   c       Krishna Fluting to the Milkmaids  Kangra painting            Much of Indian architecture  including the Taj Mahal  other works of Mughal architecture  and South Indian architecture  blends ancient local traditions with imported styles   Vernacular architecture is also regional in its flavours  Vastu shastra  literally  science of construction  or  architecture  and ascribed to Mamuni Mayan   explores how the laws of nature affect human dwellings   it employs precise geometry and directional alignments to reflect perceived cosmic constructs   As applied in Hindu temple architecture  it is influenced by the Shilpa Shastras  a series of foundational texts whose basic mythological form is the Vastu Purusha mandala  a square that embodied the  absolute    The Taj Mahal  built in Agra between      and      by orders of Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife  has been described in the UNESCO World Heritage List as  the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world s heritage    Indo Saracenic Revival architecture  developed by the British in the late   th century  drew on Indo Islamic architecture   The earliest literature in India  composed between      BCE and      CE  was in the Sanskrit language   Major works of Sanskrit literature include the Rigveda  c       BCE   c       BCE   the epics  Mah bh rata   c      BCE   c      CE  and the Ramayana   c      BCE and later   Abhij  na  kuntalam  The Recognition of  akuntal   and other dramas of K lid sa   c   th century CE  and Mah k vya poetry     In Tamil literature  the Sangam literature   c      BCE   c      BCE  consisting of       poems  composed by     poets  is the earliest work      From the   th to the   th centuries  India s literary traditions went through a period of drastic change because of the emergence of devotional poets like Kab r  Tuls d s  and Guru N nak  This period was characterised by a varied and wide spectrum of thought and expression  as a consequence  medieval Indian literary works differed significantly from classical traditions   In the   th century  Indian writers took a new interest in social questions and psychological descriptions  In the   th century  Indian literature was influenced by the works of the Bengali poet  author and philosopher Rabindranath Tagore   who was a recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature  Indian music ranges over various traditions and regional styles  Classical music encompasses two genres and their various folk offshoots  the northern Hindustani and southern Carnatic schools   Regionalised popular forms include filmi and folk music  the syncretic tradition of the bauls is a well known form of the latter  Indian dance also features diverse folk and classical forms  Among the better known folk dances are  the bhangra of Punjab  the bihu of Assam  the Jhumair and chhau of Jharkhand  Odisha and West Bengal  garba and dandiya of Gujarat  ghoomar of Rajasthan  and the lavani of Maharashtra  Eight dance forms  many with narrative forms and mythological elements  have been accorded classical dance status by India s National Academy of Music  Dance  and Drama  These are  bharatanatyam of the state of Tamil Nadu  kathak of Uttar Pradesh  kathakali and mohiniyattam of Kerala  kuchipudi of Andhra Pradesh  manipuri of Manipur  odissi of Odisha  and the sattriya of Assam   Theatre in India melds music  dance  and improvised or written dialogue   Often based on Hindu mythology  but also borrowing from medieval romances or social and political events  Indian theatre includes  the bhavai of Gujarat  the jatra of West Bengal  the nautanki and ramlila of North India  tamasha of Maharashtra  burrakatha of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana  terukkuttu of Tamil Nadu  and the yakshagana of Karnataka   India has a theatre training institute the National School of Drama  NSD  that is situated at New Delhi It is an autonomous organisation under the Ministry of Culture  Government of India   The Indian film industry produces the world s most watched cinema   Established regional cinematic traditions exist in the Assamese  Bengali  Bhojpuri  Hindi  Kannada  Malayalam  Punjabi  Gujarati  Marathi  Odia  Tamil  and Telugu languages   The Hindi language film industry  Bollywood  is the largest sector representing     of box office revenue  followed by the South Indian Telugu and Tamil film industries which represent     combined   Television broadcasting began in India in      as a state run medium of communication and expanded slowly for more than two decades    The state monopoly on television broadcast ended in the     s  Since then  satellite channels have increasingly shaped the popular culture of Indian society   Today  television is the most penetrative media in India  industry estimates indicate that as of      update  there are over     million TV consumers      million with satellite or cable connections compared to other forms of mass media such as the press      million   radio      million  or internet     million    Traditional Indian society is sometimes defined by social hierarchy  The Indian caste system embodies much of the social stratification and many of the social restrictions found on the Indian subcontinent  Social classes are defined by thousands of endogamous hereditary groups  often termed as j tis  or  castes    India declared untouchability to be illegal  in      and has since enacted other anti discriminatory laws and social welfare initiatives  Family values are important in the Indian tradition  and multi generational patrilineal joint families have been the norm in India  though nuclear families are becoming common in urban areas   An overwhelming majority of Indians  with their consent  have their marriages arranged by their parents or other family elders   Marriage is thought to be for life   and the divorce rate is extremely low   with less than one in a thousand marriages ending in divorce   Child marriages are common  especially in rural areas  many women wed before reaching     which is their legal marriageable age   Female infanticide in India  and lately female foeticide  have created skewed gender ratios  the number of missing women in the country quadrupled from    million to    million in the    year period ending in       faster than the population growth during the same period  and constituting    percent of India s female electorate   Accord to an Indian government study  an additional    million girls are unwanted and do not receive adequate care   Despite a government ban on sex selective foeticide  the practice remains commonplace in India  the result of a preference for boys in a patriarchal society   The payment of dowry  although illegal  remains widespread across class lines   Deaths resulting from dowry  mostly from bride burning  are on the rise  despite stringent anti dowry laws   Many Indian festivals are religious in origin  The best known include  Diwali  Ganesh Chaturthi  Thai Pongal  Holi  Durga Puja  Eid ul Fitr  Bakr Id  Christmas  and Vaisakhi    In the      census  about     of the population was literate  with     for men and     for women  This compares to      when the respective rates were          and      In      the rates were          and     In      the rates         and     In      they were        and       According to Latika Chaudhary  in      there were under three primary schools for every ten villages  Statistically  more caste and religious diversity reduced private spending  Primary schools taught literacy  so local diversity limited its growth   Education system of India is the world s second largest higher education System   India had over     universities         colleges  and     million schools   In India s higher education system  a significant number of seats are reserved under affirmative action policies for the historically disadvantaged  In recent decades India s improved education system is often cited as one of the main contributors to its economic development    From ancient times until the advent of the modern  the most widely worn traditional dress in India  was draped   For women it took the form of a sari  a single piece of cloth many yards long   The sari was traditionally wrapped around the lower body and the shoulder   In its modern form  it is combined with an underskirt  or Indian petticoat  and tucked in the waist band for more secure fastening  It is also commonly worn with an Indian blouse  or choli  which serves as the primary upper body garment  the sari s end passing over the shoulder serving to cover the midriff and obscure the upper body s contours   For men  a similar but shorter length of cloth  the dhoti  has served as a lower body garment   The use of stitched clothes became widespread after Muslim rule was established at first by the Delhi sultanate  ca      CE  and then continued by the Mughal Empire  ca      CE    Among the garments introduced during this time and still commonly worn are  the shalwars and pyjamas  both styles of trousers  and the tunics kurta and kameez   In southern India  the traditional draped garments were to see much longer continuous use   Shalwars are atypically wide at the waist but narrow to a cuffed bottom  They are held up by a drawstring  which causes them to become pleated around the waist   The pants can be wide and baggy  or they can be cut quite narrow  on the bias  in which case they are called churidars  When they are ordinarily wide at the waist and their bottoms are hemmed but not cuffed  they are called pyjamas  The kameez is a long shirt or tunic   its side seams left open below the waist line    The kurta is traditionally collarless and made of cotton or silk  it is worn plain or with embroidered decoration  such as chikan  and typically falls to either just above or just below the wearer s knees   In the last    years  fashions have changed a great deal in India  Increasingly  in urban northern India  the sari is no longer the apparel of everyday wear  though they remain popular on formal occasions   The traditional shalwar kameez is rarely worn by younger urban women  who favour churidars or jeans    In white collar office settings  ubiquitous air conditioning allows men to wear sports jackets year round   For weddings and formal occasions  men in the middle  and upper classes often wear bandgala  or short Nehru jackets  with pants  with the groom and his groomsmen sporting sherwanis and churidars   The dhoti  once the universal garment of Hindu males  the wearing of which in the homespun and handwoven khadi allowed Gandhi to bring Indian nationalism to the millions   is seldom seen in the cities   The foundation of a typical Indian meal is a cereal cooked in a plain fashion and complemented with flavourful savoury dishes   The cooked cereal could be steamed rice  chapati  a thin unleavened bread made from wheat flour  or occasionally cornmeal  and griddle cooked dry   the idli  a steamed breakfast cake  or  dosa  a griddled pancake  both leavened and made from a batter of rice  and gram meal    The savoury dishes might include lentils  pulses and vegetables commonly spiced with ginger and garlic  but also with a combination of spices that may include coriander  cumin  turmeric  cinnamon  cardamon and others as informed by culinary conventions   They might also include poultry  fish  or meat dishes  In some instances  the ingredients might be mixed during the process of cooking   A platter  or thali  used for eating usually has a central place reserved for the cooked cereal  and peripheral ones for the flavourful accompaniments  which are often served in small bowls  The cereal and its accompaniments are eaten simultaneously rather than a piecemeal manner   This is accomplished by mixing for example of rice and lentils or  folding  wrapping  scooping or dipping such as chapati and cooked vegetables or lentils   India has distinctive vegetarian cuisines  each a feature of the geographical and cultural histories of its adherents   The appearance of ahimsa  or the avoidance of violence toward all forms of life in many religious orders early in Indian history  especially Upanishadic Hinduism  Buddhism and Jainism  is thought to have contributed to the predominance of vegetarianism among a large segment of India s Hindu population  especially in southern India  Gujarat  the Hindi speaking belt of north central India  as well as among Jains    Although meat is eaten widely in India   the proportional consumption of meat in the overall diet is low   Unlike China  which has increased its per capita meat consumption substantially in its years of increased economic growth  in India the strong dietary traditions have contributed to dairy  rather than meat  becoming the preferred form of animal protein consumption   The most significant import of cooking techniques into India during the last millennium occurred during the Mughal Empire  Dishes such as the pilaf   developed in the Abbasid caliphate   and cooking techniques such as the marinating of meat in yogurt  spread into northern India from regions to its northwest    In the food served in Indian restaurants worldwide the diversity of Indian food has been partially concealed by the dominance of Punjabi cuisine  The popularity of tandoori chicken cooked in the tandoor oven  which had traditionally been used for baking bread in the rural Punjab and the Delhi region  especially among Muslims  but which is originally from Central Asia dates to the     s  and was caused in large part by an entrepreneurial response among people from the Punjab who had been displaced by the      partition of India   Cricket is the most popular sport in India   Major domestic competitions include the Indian Premier League  which is the most watched cricket league in the world and ranks sixth among all sports leagues   Other professional leagues include the pro football and the pro Kabaddi leagues     India has won two Cricket world cups and has eight field hockey gold medals in the summer olympics   Several traditional indigenous sports remain fairly popular  such as kabaddi  kho kho  pehlwani and gilli danda  Some of the earliest forms of Asian martial arts  such as Kalarippayattu  musti yuddha  dubious    discuss  silambam  and marma adi  originated in India  Chess  commonly held to have originated in India as chatura ga  is regaining widespread popularity with the rise in the number of Indian grandmasters    Pachisi  from which parcheesi derives  was played on a giant marble court by Akbar   The improved results garnered by the Indian Davis Cup team and other Indian tennis players in the early     s have made tennis increasingly popular in the country   India has a comparatively strong presence in shooting sports  and has won several medals at the Olympics  the World Shooting Championships  and the Commonwealth Games    Other sports in which Indians have succeeded internationally include badminton   Saina Nehwal and P V Sindhu are two of the top ranked female badminton players in the world   boxing   and wrestling   Football is popular in West Bengal  Goa  Tamil Nadu  Kerala  and the north eastern states   India has hosted or co hosted several international sporting events  the      and      Asian Games  the             and      Cricket World Cup tournaments  the      Afro Asian Games  the      ICC Champions Trophy  the      World Badminton Championships  the      Hockey World Cup  the      Commonwealth Games  and the      FIFA U    World Cup  Major international sporting events held annually in India include the Maharashtra Open  the Mumbai Marathon  the Delhi Half Marathon  and the Indian Masters  The first Formula   Indian Grand Prix featured in late      but has been discontinued from the F  season calendar since        India has traditionally been the dominant country at the South Asian Games  An example of this dominance is the basketball competition where the Indian team won three out of four tournaments to date    Overview Etymology History Geography Biodiversity Politics Foreign relations and military Economy Demographics Art Culture Government
